# Logical Operators Implementation Plan

## Goal
Implement the remaining logical operators: NOT operator to complete logical operator support.

## Current Status
- ✅ AND operator: Implemented and working
- ✅ OR operator: Implemented and working  
- ❌ NOT operator: Missing

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Logical Operator Implementation
- Review existing AND/OR implementation in evaluate_compound_condition()
- Understand current operator precedence handling
- Document current logical operator patterns

### Step 2: Design NOT Operator Implementation
- NOT has highest precedence (before AND and OR)
- Support format: `NOT condition`
- Handle nested NOT: `NOT NOT condition`
- Plan recursive evaluation for complex expressions

### Step 3: Implement NOT Operator
- Add NOT operator handling to evaluate_compound_condition()
- Implement proper precedence: NOT > AND > OR
- Handle single and multiple NOT operators
- Test with simple NOT conditions

### Step 4: Test NOT Operator
- Test simple NOT: `NOT A > 5`
- Test NOT with AND: `NOT A > 5 AND B < 10`
- Test NOT with OR: `NOT A > 5 OR B < 10`
- Test nested NOT: `NOT NOT A > 5`
- Test in IF statements and WHILE loops

### Step 5: Add to Regression Suite
- Add comprehensive NOT operator tests to tests/regression.bas
- Verify no existing functionality is broken
- Test all logical operator combinations

### Step 6: Create Dedicated Test Cases
- Create tests/logical_complete_test.bas
- Test all logical operator combinations
- Test operator precedence
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Implementation Details

### NOT Operator Precedence
- NOT has highest precedence
- Evaluation order: NOT → AND → OR
- Examples:
  - `NOT A > 5 AND B < 10` = `(NOT A > 5) AND (B < 10)`
  - `A > 5 OR NOT B < 10` = `(A > 5) OR (NOT B < 10)`
  - `NOT A > 5 OR NOT B < 10` = `(NOT A > 5) OR (NOT B < 10)`

### Code Location
- Target: `evaluate_compound_condition()` function
- Add NOT handling before AND and OR
- Reuse existing condition evaluation logic

### Success Criteria
- `NOT A > 5` works correctly
- `NOT A > 5 AND B < 10` works correctly
- `A > 5 OR NOT B < 10` works correctly
- All existing AND/OR functionality preserved
- Proper operator precedence maintained
- All regression tests pass
