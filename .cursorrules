# BASHIC Project Cursor Rules

## Git Workflow Shortcuts
- `.` = `git add .` - Stage all changes
- `..` = `git commit -m "quick commit"` - Quick commit with generic message  
- `++` = `git push` - Push to remote

## Commit Guidelines
- Always commit BEFORE making changes
- Keep commit messages very short (under 50 chars)
- Use imperative mood: "fix", "add", "update", not "fixed", "added", "updated"
- No emojis, em-dashes, or non-ASCII characters anywhere
- Commit frequently between logical changes

## Code Standards
- Bash only - no external dependencies
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
- Functions should be small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add debug statements for complex logic
- Test each module/segment when modifying code
- Don't modify large sections at once - make incremental changes

## Documentation Rules  
- No emojis or special characters in docs
- Use plain ASCII text only
- Keep documentation concise and practical
- Update TODO.md for any new tasks or issues found
- Document known limitations clearly

## Testing Requirements
- Test code after each change
- Run test programs (test1.bas, test2.bas) after interpreter changes
- Don't iterate more than twice on solving a problem - stop and ask for guidance
- Create test cases for new features

## File Organization
- Keep project structure clean
- Use clear directory hierarchy
- Name files descriptively
- Group related functionality

## Development Process
- Plan changes in small steps
- Commit before starting work
- Test immediately after changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Don't add unnecessary complexity

## Efficiency Guidelines
- Use parallel operations when possible
- Prefer built-in bash features over external tools
- Optimize for readability over cleverness
- Cache results when appropriate
- Avoid redundant operations

## Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages with context
- Include line numbers in interpreter errors when possible
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Validate inputs early
- Use consistent error reporting format

## Performance Considerations
- Profile regex patterns for efficiency
- Minimize subprocess calls
- Use bash arrays effectively
- Avoid deep recursion
- Monitor memory usage for large programs

## Security Guidelines
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize file paths
- Use quotes around variables
- Avoid eval and similar dangerous constructs
- Check file permissions before operations
